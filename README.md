# 📌 Notes

This project uses Windows-specific libraries (Windows.h and conio.h), so it will only run on Windows systems.



# ✨ Features

• Interactive keyboard controls (number keys for moves)
• Animated symbol selection menu (X or O)
• Colored X and O symbols using console text attributes
• Randomized computer opponent
• Clean, centered console UI
• Cursor visibility control for smoother visuals
• Fully playable inside Command Prompt



# 🛠 Technologies Used

• C++
• Standard Library (iostream, vector, ctime)
• Windows API (Windows.h)
• Console input handling (conio.h)



# ▶ How to Run
*Option 1 – Run the Executable (Recommended)*

If you don’t have an IDE like Visual Studio to compile the .cpp file, you can still play the game by running the provided executable (.exe) file.

Download the project files, and open the .exe file. The game will open automatically in Command Prompt with no additional setup required.


*Option 2 – Compile the Source Code*

If you want to compile the .cpp file yourself:

Open the project in your IDE, Build it and run the program.
