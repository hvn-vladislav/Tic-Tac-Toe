# ▶ How to Run

*Option 1 – Run the Executable (Recommended)*

If you don’t have an IDE like Visual Studio to compile the .cpp file, you can still play the game by running the provided executable (.exe) file.

Download the project files, and open the .exe file. The game will open automatically in Command Prompt with no additional setup required.


*Option 2 – Compile the Source Code*

If you want to compile the .cpp file yourself:

Open the project in your IDE, Build it and run the program.
